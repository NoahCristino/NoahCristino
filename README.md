Hello 👋

My name is Noah Cristino. I am a Software Engineer committed to building reliable 🧑‍🔧, scalable 📈, and efficient 🚀 software in order to help bridge the gap between innovation💡and execution 👨🏻‍💻.

In my freetime I work on my startup 🤖, write technical articles 📝, and self-study AI 📚. Most of my personal work focuses on leveraging the power of AI🕵️‍♂️ and natural language processing 💬 to understand human emotions and sentiment 😁😐😢. I am also interested in how these systems can be efficiently deployed ☁️ for use in real world applications 🌎.
